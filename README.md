# Deep Learning @ KTH (DD2424)

## Assignment 1
Implementing a one layer network from scratch 
- [x] Initial implementation using cross-entropy loss and L2 regularization and mini-batches
- [x] Bonus 1: Improvements to the network (Shuffling data for each epoch, longer training, using all data, decaying learning rate, Xavier initialization)
- [x] Bonus 2: SVM loss function
